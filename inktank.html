   <p>
     InkTank is an app that inspires users while providing a user friendly way to navigate tattoo images, tattoo artists, and tattoo shops. Creating a smooth user experience while helping to organize gathered results and provide a means to book an appointment creates a positive user experience, ultimately helping achieve the goal of avoiding future regret. From competitive research to determining the problem to solve to establishing empathy for users, User Centered Design remained true throughout the whole process.

   <h3>Research</h3>
   <p>
    I conducted a Competitive Analysis to determine what users currently expect from a tattoo app as well as determine opportunities to meet a need by using InkTank. The two most prevalent apps in the tattoo world include Tattoodo and InkHunter. By analyzing their profile including a marketing profile and SWOT profile, I was able to note weaknesses and prepare a well-informed strategy.

   <h3>Ideation</h3>
   <p>
     User stories were created and helped to bring a human voice to the user. The stories also provided insight for the creation of desired features.
     Collecting all data obtained, I began sorting and mapping using Affinity Mapping. Insights were noted and User Personas were created to provide a face for the users. By creating User Personas, I was able to stay focused on a User Centered Design. After all, it is all about the user right?
     User Journeys were then scripted to visualize the process the users would follow. These provided a basic foundation in which to start designing desired features.
     User Flows were then prepared and provided a nice diagram of what pages would be required in the InkTank app.

   <h3>Wireframe</h3>
   <p>
     Wireframes were created in low, mid, and high fidelity. Sketches in low fidelity allowed for quick revisions and modifications. Mid-fidelity illustrated more functions of the app. Finally, high fidelity allowed for user interaction. Users were able to get a feel for how the app worked. As the UX Researcher in this case, I was able to observe processes, pain points, and the successes and unsuccessful moments of user flow. Thereby, I continued to produce, create, and design more iterations.

   <h3>Design</h3>
   <p>
     Usability Testing provided further insight into the minds of the users. By providing tasks for the users to complete, monitoring user's body language during the testing, and analyzing results in a Rainbow Spreadsheet, I gathered valuable information to apply to the design of InkTank.
     Visual Design Principles were then taken into consideration to assure the app was aesthetically pleasing. I wanted the user to feel a sense of mystery while using the app. Therefore, color palette was considered as well as layout and image selections. Designing for accessibility was practiced as well. Pages of InkTank evolved as Iterative Design was practiced throughout the whole process.

   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>
     The evolution of InkTank was vast. From competitive research to determining the problem to solve to establishing empathy for users, User Centered Design remained true throughout the whole process. 
     p.s. I evolved as a UX designer/researcher too!
